# Stock Portfolio Dashboard with Dash

This project takes a Thinkorswim data export and turns it into a Dash Dashboard. <br>
The columns in the **monitor > Activity and Positions** table in Thinkorswim need to match the screenshot. 
There are 3 excel exports included in the repo you can use to run this project.
